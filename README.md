## Introduction
Traditional paper-based medical records are being replaced by electronic health records (EHRs) due to their efficiency and enhanced security. However, challenges such as interoperability and privacy concerns have arisen. The Government of India has initiated the National Digital Health Mission (NHDM) to tackle these challenges. This application, developed as part of the GRiD initiative, utilizes a blockchain infrastructure to address interoperability, privacy, and data redundancy issues associated with EHRs.

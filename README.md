## Introduction:
Traditional paper-based medical records are being replaced by electronic health records (EHRs) due to their efficiency and enhanced security. However, challenges such as interoperability and privacy concerns have arisen. The Government of India has initiated the National Digital Health Mission (NHDM) to tackle these challenges. This application, developed as part of the FlipKart GRiD initiative, utilizes a blockchain infrastructure to address interoperability, privacy, and data redundancy issues associated with EHRs.

## Features:

- Set up a blockchain infrastructure for:
  - Identity management
  - Medical records management
- User interfaces tailored for different stakeholders:
  - Clinic
  - Hospital
  - Individual Doctors
  - Diagnostics
  - Patient
- Integration of blockchain infrastructure with Health Stack
- Seamless integration with Abha ID and Aadhar for robust identity management
- Efficient document search using various criteria:
  - Date
  - Doctor
  - Document Type
  - Hospital Name
  - Patient Name
- Document sharing in different formats:
  - Image
  - PDF
- Streamlined digitization of Personal Health Record (PHR) documents
